<summary><h2>My Coding Journey</h2></summary>
Do you remember those hacker movies from your childhood that made you fascinated with the idea of computers? I saw 'Wargames' as a young kid and became fascinated with the idea that I could hack my grades (not that you should ever actually do this). Then I watched 'Hackers,' and the idea of being in a group of people rebelling against a massive corporation filled with corruption was so interestingâ€”what the power of a single computer could do. I think by now everyone has seen 'The Matrix,' and, well, you know that story. All these movies made me fascinated with computers, but I couldn't afford one, and I didn't grow up in a time where you could have easy access to them. So, my fascination for them became something I simply enjoyed reading or watching movies about.

Years went by, and I enlisted in the military, went to college, got a degree, married an amazing person and my fascination for computers and what you can do with them was still there, but I never followed it. This brings me to nowâ€”finally pursuing something that has interested me since childhood. The decision to pursue this dream was not easy; I quit my job, started self-teaching, went to a coding school, and continue to learn while I look for work in this industry. The tech industry is a place I never thought I would work in because I never thought I would be able to succeed in it, but I was wrong. So here I am, pursuing my dream, albeit a bit late to the party, but with all the same excitement.
